# Pre-Assignment Materials - Full Stack Program starting on August 16th

Hi there – we’re super excited to have you on board this journey!

[x] The Integrify learning experience will begin with some third-party self-learning materials and a couple of assignments. The idea is to have everyone grasp the fundamentals before jumping on to the immersive live-lecture & project-based learning that the actual program entails from August 16th onwards.

> The document is divided into three sections;

> 1.  Basics of HTML & CSS
> 2.  Combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
> 3.  Additional sources & content

We hope you will reserve enough time to **complete A & B sections by August 13th** to ensure you’re able to keep up with the program. Our philosophy is taking on difficult tasks, but getting enough support to get through them, so **feel free to reach out to Duy Nguyen via Slack or email** _(duy.nguyen@integrify.io)_ in case you need help, additional materials, or other technical guidance.

> Good luck and see you on August 16th at the latest!

        > Best regards,
        > Full Stack instructors & Integrify Team
