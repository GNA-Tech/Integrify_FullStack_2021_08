# Pre-Assignment Materials - Full Stack Program starting on August 16th

Hi there – we’re super excited to have you on board this journey!

[x] The Integrify learning experience will begin with some third-party self-learning materials and a couple of assignments. The idea is to have everyone grasp the fundamentals before jumping on to the immersive live-lecture & project-based learning that the actual program entails from August 16th onwards.

> The document is divided into three sections;

> 1.  Basics of HTML & CSS
> 2.  Combining HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
> 3.  Additional sources & content

We hope you will reserve enough time to **complete A & B sections by August 13th** to ensure you’re able to keep up with the program. Our philosophy is taking on difficult tasks, but getting enough support to get through them, so **feel free to reach out to Duy Nguyen via Slack or email** _(duy.nguyen@integrify.io)_ in case you need help, additional materials, or other technical guidance.

> Good luck and see you on August 16th at the latest!

         Best regards,
         Full Stack instructors & Integrify Team

Code the below page with HTML & CSS without using the generated code in Figma (only for design reference). The page should be static, meaning that buttons lead to nowhere. Try to stick to the design as much as possible for both Desktop & Mobile.
